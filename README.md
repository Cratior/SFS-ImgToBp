# SFS-ImgToBp
this python script lets you input a png or jpg and will out put a blueprint for the game SpaceFlight simulator

#how to use
first download
run the 'start.bat'
either input your image or choose an example
wait
then your file shoud automaticly download to the the folder that the script is in
move that folder toy your apaceflight simulator folder > saving > blueprint 

#⚠️important⚠️
the image should have a WHITE background
it is best if the input image is an outline of what you want. Any colors will work (rxccept white) and that is what the script converts
currently the script will only ise one size fuel tank i have tried to fix but its not workin i will add it later
please if the imagr is large either lowwer the resolution or
use the scale factor. the scale factor only makes the craft dmaller and dose not affect the ammount of parts
i will try to update it sp it wont just output thousands of fuel tanks
